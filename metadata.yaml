description: I was very unhappy, from a variety of causes, definable and undefinable.
  My chambermaid had been cross for a week, and, by talking to my cook, had made her
  dissatis-fied with her place. The mother of five little children, I felt that I
  had a weight of care and responsibility greater than I could support. I was unequal
  to the task. My spirits fell under its bare contemplation. Then I had been disappointed
  in a seamstress, and my children were, as the saying is, "in rags." While brooding
  over these and other dishearte-ning circumstances, Netty, my chambermaid, opened
  the door of the room where I was sitting, (it was Monday morning,) and said- "Harriet
  has just sent word that she is sick, and can't come to-day." "Then you and Agnes
  will have to do the washing," I replied, in a fretful voice; this new source of
  trouble completely breaking me down. "Indeed, ma'am," replied Netty, tossing her
  head and speaking with some pertness, "I can't do the washing. I didn't engage for
  any thing but chamber-work."
